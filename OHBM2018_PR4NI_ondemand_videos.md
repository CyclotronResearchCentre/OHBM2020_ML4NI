# Pattern Recognition for NeuroImaging

---

Program and video lectures from the OHBM 2018 Educational Course *Pattern Recognition for NeuroImaging* organised by [Janaina Mourao-Miranda](http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and [Christophe Phillips](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/en/directory?uid=U016440).

Most [symposia](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/8246/sections/12538), [keynote](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/8246/sections/12540) and [oral sessions](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/8246/sections/12541) from OHBM2018 program are available and so are the individual  lectures from the [Educational Courses](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/8246/sections/12542). Unfortunately these are dumped together, without any specific ordering or grouping but for titles' alphabetical order. 

Here are the lectures from the [PR4NI](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2018/ED/Pattern%20Recognition.pdf) course, as originally planned:
